-- **Office Hours: Tu 10:30-11:30, Wed 1-3 at Harney 121B**

There is a good chance for me to be on campus on: 

 Monday Mornings &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tuesday 9:30 - 10:30 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wednesday mornings &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thursday mornings


-- Course website: https://github.com/Numerical-Analysis/course

Canvas is for grades recording and announcements.

-- Please read the [Syllabus](NumericalMethods_Syllabus.pdf) very carefully. This is our contract. 

-- There are no mandary textbook. I will write up [notes](NumericalMethodsNotes.pdf) and update it after every lecture. Some [Jupyter notebooks](/nbs) will be used during lecture.
### Recommended textbook
- (Buy this book if you can) *Numerical methods: design, analysis, and computer implementation of algorithms*, Anne, Greenbaum, and Timothy P. Chartier. Princeton University Press, 2012.
- *Numerical Linear Algebra*, Trefethen and Bau, Siam 1997

### Software
Python 2.7 and Jupyter Notebook. I recommend you install [Ananconda (Python 2.7 version)](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), which will get you both. PyCharm is also recommended.

### Classroom policy
- Arrive on time. 
- Have your electronics silenced.
- I ask you to be respectful of me and your classmates and to refrain from surfing the web or using social media (facebook, twitter, etc) or messaging programs during class. It is absolutely forbidden to use instant messaging programs, email, etc. during class lectures or quizzes.

## About GitHub
- You need to have a GitHub account. Your username should reflect your real name as much as possible so that I know who I am grading. Enter your real name in your public profile. **Please send me your github username by Aug 23 11:59 pm at the email address above.** 
- A quick guide on branches and pull requests: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

## How to do your python projects
- Step 1: When logged into Github, go to the link for that project.
- Step 2: Authorize GitHub Classroom (Only need to be done the first time)
- Step 3: Accept this assignment. Upon accepting, a private repository will be created for you. You can find this repository again by clicking https://github.com/Numerical-Analysis. 
- Step 4: Do your project according to the instructions listed on README.md. 
```diff
-Only the master branch will be graded. So put your to-be-graded-work under master branch.
```
- Step 5: No submission is needed. I will be able to see all your edits. You can edit as much as you want before the deadline. Stop committing to the master branch after the deadline, or a penalty could be applied.

## Contribute to the class and get help on github 
**You can always get help by emailing me, coming to my office hours, or making an appointment**
- Feel free to add resources and thoughts that you think will benefit the whole class to [Wiki](https://github.com/Numerical-Analysis/course/wiki). I will give extra credit for reasonable/good contributions.
- Create an [issue](https://github.com/Numerical-Analysis/course/issues) if you find a typo/mistake on my answer key or my notes. Once confirmed, I will update my files and assign you extra credit (first come first serve). The extra credit will be recorded under [ExtraCredit.md](ExtraCredit.md). 
- If you want to ask project related questions, please create an issue under your own private repository of that project. Only you and I can see this issue.
- If you want to ask course material/written homework related question, you can also create an [issue](https://github.com/Numerical-Analysis/course/issues), especially if you think this is a common question.
- Since the repository [course](https://github.com/Numerical-Analysis/course) is public, so be aware that all the issues under the repository is public and cannot be deleted.
