## About GitHub
- You need to have a GitHub account. Your username should reflect your real name as much as possible so that I know who I am grading. Enter your real name in your public profile. **Please send me your github username by Aug 23 11:59 pm at the email address above.** 
- A quick guide on branches and pull requests: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

## How to do your python projects
- Step 1: Go to the link for that project.
- Step 2: Authorize GitHub Classroom (Only need to be done the first time)
- Step 3: Accept this assignment. Upon accepting, a private repository will be created for you. You can find this repository again by clicking https://github.com/Numerical-Analysis. 
- Step 4: Do your project according to the instructions listed on INSTRUCTION.md
- Step 5: There is no submission button. I will be able to see your work saved before the deadline. 
```diff
- Only the master branch is graded.
```

## Contribute to the class and getting help on github 
**You can always get help by emailing me, coming to my office hours, or make an appointment**
- Feel free to add resources and thoughts that you think will benefit the whole class to [students.md](students.md), then request to merge to the master branch. If approved, extra credit will be assigned.
- Create an [issue](https://github.com/Numerical-Analysis/course/issues) if you find a typo/mistake on my answer key or my notes. Once confirmed, I will update my files and assign you extra credit (typos excluded, first come first serve). The extra credit will be recorded under [ExtraCredit.md](ExtraCredit.md). 
- If you want to ask project related questions, please create an issue under your own private repository of that project. 
- If you want to ask course material/written homework related question, you can also create an [issue](https://github.com/Numerical-Analysis/course/issues), especially if you think this is a common question.
